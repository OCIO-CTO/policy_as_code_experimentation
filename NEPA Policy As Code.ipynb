    "# Two-Stage Regulatory Rule Extraction Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 1: Maximal Inclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extract every paragraph or section that could possibly be a rule, with minimal filtering.\n",
    "- Output a comprehensive list of candidate rules, each with full regulatory text and metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Stage 2: Actionability Assessment & Code Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use AI or rule-based logic to classify each candidate as actionable or not.\n",
    "- For actionable items, generate code logic or automation instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach maximizes coverage and enables more nuanced, context-aware filtering and automation in the second stage."

    "This notebook will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parse the USDA NEPA XML (`title-7.xml`) using `xmltodict`.\n",
    "2. Traverse all sections and paragraphs to identify regulatory requirements.\n",
    "3. Extract each requirement as a structured JSON rule, including:\n",
    "   - Regulatory text\n",
    "   - Metadata (citation, effective date, authority)\n",
    "   - Explanation of the rule's intent\n",
    "4. Output all rules as a formatted JSON list for review.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures all regulatory requirements are captured and ready for further translation into code logic."

The CEs in this section are for proposals for financial assistance that involve no or minimal alterations in the physical environment and typically occur on previously disturbed land.

However, based on the review of the project description, the Agency may request additional environmental documentation from the applicant at any time, specifically if the Agency determines that extraordinary circumstances may exist. In accordance with section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (54 U.S.C. 300101-306108) and its implementing regulations under 36 CFR 800.3(a), the agency has determined that the actions in this section are undertakings, and in accordance with 36 CFR 800.3(a)(1) has identified those undertakings for which no further review under 36 CFR part 800 is required because they have no potential to cause effects to historic properties. In accordance with section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531-1544) and its implementing regulations at 50 CFR part 402, the agency has determined that the actions in this section are actions for purposes of the Endangered Species Act, and in accordance with 50 CFR 402.06 has identified those actions for which no further review under 50 CFR part 402 is required because they will have no effect to listed threatened and endangered species.\",\n",
