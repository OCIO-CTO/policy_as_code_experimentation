    "# Step-by-Step: Extracting Regulatory Policy Rules as Structured JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parse the USDA NEPA XML (`title-7.xml`) using `xmltodict`.\n",
    "2. Traverse all sections and paragraphs to identify regulatory requirements.\n",
    "3. Extract each requirement as a structured JSON rule, including:\n",
    "   - Regulatory text\n",
    "   - Metadata (citation, effective date, authority)\n",
    "   - Explanation of the rule's intent\n",
    "4. Output all rules as a formatted JSON list for review.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach ensures all regulatory requirements are captured and ready for further translation into code logic."
