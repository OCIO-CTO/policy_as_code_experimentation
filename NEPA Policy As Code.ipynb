USDA and its agencies' regulations were promulgated as a “supplement” that “incorporates and adopts” the CEQ's NEPA regulations, see 7 CFR 1b.1(a). However, the CEQ regulations (40 CFR parts 1500 through 1508) no longer provide a valid foundation for USDA NEPA regulations. Second, Congress recently amended NEPA in significant part, in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (FRA), Public Law 118-5, signed on June 3, 2023, in which Congress added substantial detail and direction in Title I of NEPA regarding procedural issues that CEQ and individual acting agencies had previously addressed in their own procedures. USDA recognized the need to update its regulations considering these significant legislative changes. Since USDA's regulations were originally designed as a supplement to CEQ's NEPA regulations, USDA had been awaiting CEQ action before revising its regulations, consistent with CEQ direction. \\n                        \\n                         40 CFR 1507.3(b) (2024); see also 86 FR 34154 (June 29, 2021). However, with CEQ's regulations now rescinded, and with USDA's NEPA implementing procedures still unmodified more than two years after this significant legislative overhaul, it is exigent that USDA move quickly to conform its procedures to the statute as amended. And third, the U.S. Supreme Court recently issued a landmark decision in \\n                        \\n                         v. \\n                        \\n                         145 S. Ct. 1497 (2025), in which it decried the “transform[ation]” of NEPA from its roots as “a modest procedural requirement,” into a significant “substantive roadblock” that “paralyze[s]” “agency decision-making.” \\n                        \\n                         at 1507, 1513 (quotations omitted). The Supreme Court explained that part of that problem had been caused by decisions of lower courts, which it rejected, issuing a “course correction” mandating that courts give “substantial deference” to reasonable agency conclusions underlying its NEPA process. \\n                        \\n                         at 1513-14. But the Court also acknowledged, and through its course correction sought to address, the effect on “litigation-averse agencies” which, in light of judicial “micromanage[ment],” had been “tak[ing] ever more time and [\\u2009] prepar[ing] ever longer EISs [environmental impact statements] for future projects.” \\n                        \\n                         at 1513.

       "    \"These reasons now prompt USDA to publish this interim final rule to revise, move and republish, or remove portions of the USDA NEPA implementing regulations, as well as add new portions, given the CEQ NEPA regulations no longer provide a foundation for USDA NEPA regulations and leave the Department without necessary interpretation of, and implementing procedures for, NEPA. NEPA is a vital part of Federal agency planning and decision-making, and USDA agencies need clear standards and guidelines as soon as possible to conduct the work of providing critical services and funds to Americans, as directed by Congress. Conducting a standard rulemaking process would impede USDA's planning and decision-making for longer than necessary and would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest. For these reasons, USDA is using the interim final rule process. (Also see discussion under Section III. for additional rationale for using the interim rule process.)\",\n",

Therefore, USDA is proposing to correct course and right-size its NEPA regulations consistent with applicable law.\",\n",

Where some agency-specific NEPA regulations identified categories of actions generally requiring an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement, these sections have not been carried forward into 7 CFR 1b. NEPA does not require the identification of categories of actions other than those actions that are categorically excluded from documentation in an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement when a Federal agency has \\n                        \\n                        determined the actions normally do not significantly affect the quality of the human environment within the meaning of NEPA §\\u2009102(2)(C), 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C), NEPA §\\u2009111(1), 42 U.S.C. 4336e(1)). Because the determination of no significance was made during the process of establishing the categorical exclusion, it is the consideration of whether an extraordinary circumstance exists that may preclude the use of the category (see 7 CFR 1b.3(f)). In determining whether a categorical exclusion applies to a proposed action, and therefore does not require preparation of an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement, an agency should evaluate the action for extraordinary circumstances that indicate a normally excluded action is likely to have reasonably foreseeable significant adverse effect. Determinations of whether to prepare an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement should be based on the anticipated degree of effect, in accordance with NEPA, not on the type of action. An environmental assessment shall be prepared when a Federal agency finds that a categorical exclusion does not apply to an action and the action does not have a reasonably foreseeable significant impact on the quality of the human environment, or the significance of such effect is unknown (NEPA §\\u2009106(b)(2) (42 U.S.C. 4336(b)(2); 7 CFR 1b.2(f)(iv)(A)) and 1b.5(a)). An environmental impact statement shall be issued when a Federal agency finds that a categorical exclusion does not apply and determines an action has a reasonably foreseeable significant impact on the quality of the human environment (NEPA §\\u2009106(b)(1) 42 U.S.C. 4336(b)(1); 7 CFR 1b.2(f)(iv)(B) and 1b.7(a)).

Instead of leaving the list of types of effects as disparate disclosures, USDA finds it logical to bring these together when it comes to considerations for significance. The terms “compares to” and “contributes to,” as included in the considerations for significance, provide the necessary precision or focus for conducting the analysis of the effects and considering how the potential impacts compare to the consequences, especially as it relates to effects on public health and safety, economics, and the quality of life of the American people, as well as identifying irreversible and irretrievable commitments and how these contribute to loss of long-term productivity for the human environment.

This documentation of how the responsible official proceeded and why is advantageous to demonstrating that decisions made during the iterative NEPA process are not arbitrary or capricious; however, experience implementing the previous CEQ NEPA regulation requirement for responding to comments has demonstrated this process led to burdensome and time-consuming efforts that routinely prevented USDA subcomponents from meeting the 2-year deadline for completing an EIS, which is now mandated in NEPA §\\u2009107(g)(1)(A), 42 U.S.C. 4336a(g)(1)(A).

This revises the previous codification at 7 CFR 1970.53(d)(4), which required an environmental report. Since 2016, the agency has reviewed numerous projects of this type (overhead-to-underground conversion) as a categorical exclusion without significant impact on the environment and therefore has determined they were improperly excluded in previous rulemaking [March 2, 2016, 81 FR 11032].',\n",

The change from one (1) mile to twenty (20) miles is based on the review and analysis of environmental assessments issued by the agency, as well as other Federal agency categorical exclusions. In addition, the removal of small-scale corridor development that increased capacity by more than 30 percent of the existing user population as a threshold requiring an environmental assessment, as previously codified at 7 CFR 1970.54(b)(2)(ii), is based on the review and analysis of environmental assessments issued by the agency, which documents that making the modifications will not normally result in significant effects on the environment. Rural Development has the administrative record of applying 7 CFR1970.53(b)(2) since the promulgation of 7 CFR 1970 and has found no instances where the review was elevated to an environmental assessment due to extraordinary circumstances. Further, the agency has reviewed records for over 100 environmental assessments completed for projects that proposed expansion of the distribution or collection system past one mile of the currently served areas or otherwise increased the capacity by more than 30 percent of the existing user population and found all of these to have concluded in a finding of no significant impact on the environment.

The categorical exclusions requiring documentation did not change.

(Now 7 CFR 1b.4(d)(33).) An allotment management plan (AMP) is a document that specifies how the components of the program action will be implemented to reach a given set of objectives. An AMP is prepared in consultation with the permittee(s) associated with the allotment, and it prescribes the manner and extent to which livestock operations will be conducted; describes the type, location, and construction specifications for rangeland improvements; and contains such other provisions relating to livestock grazing on the associated allotment (see 36 CFR 222.1(b)). AMPs are created after a unit's land management plan and a site-specific grazing decision, both of which undergo their own NEPA analysis. An AMP is the outcome of the grazing decision process. The presence or absence of an AMP does not change the on-the-ground effects of a rangeland improvement because AMPs do not override land management plans or grazing decisions. As such, the revision of language in the categorical exclusion is a minor change and technical in nature and does not modify the way rangeland improvements are designed or implemented, nor what is authorized in the land management plan or the grazing decision. Currently, most Forest Service grazing allotments have AMPs in place, making this CE unavailable to them. The proposed minor wording change will allow Federal agencies to efficiently maintain or improve rangeland conditions and animal distribution by eliminating a restriction based on paperwork requirements rather than indicators of whether the action may have significant effects, as was considered when initially establishing the category.\",\n",
