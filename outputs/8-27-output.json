There is no requirement in NEPA to address comments in writing; however, documentation of how comments were considered is highly encouraged to demonstrate the rationale for how the responsible official decides to proceed during the iterative development of the proposed action and action alternatives and the iterative analysis process. This documentation of how the responsible official proceeded and why is advantageous to demonstrating that decisions made during the iterative NEPA process are not arbitrary or capricious; however, experience implementing the previous CEQ NEPA regulation requirement for responding to comments has demonstrated this process led to burdensome and time-consuming efforts that routinely prevented USDA subcomponents from meeting the 2-year deadline for completing an EIS, which is now mandated in NEPA \u00a7\u2009107(g)(1)(A), 42 U.S.C. 4336a(g)(1)(A). Additionally, the approach to \u201cresponse to comments\u201d that has been employed by some USDA subcomponents was not always the most effective in that it did not focus on demonstrating the action the responsible official took in response to the substantive issue raised and/or recommendation made. In some cases, the \u201cresponse to comments\u201d documentation generated levels of paperwork that exceeded the page count of the environmental document itself, defying one of the key principles of NEPA to generate \u201cbetter decisions, not better documents\u201d. For this reason, this section also clarifies that if documentation is completed to demonstrate how comments were considered and addressed, the documentation should focus on capturing the actions taken, as specified at 7 CFR 1b.7(f)(2), to facilitate a more efficient and effective approach to demonstrating how the responsible official responded to the substantive issue raised and/or recommendation made to improve the decision made on how to proceed (for example, issues to be analyzed in detail, alternatives to be considered or analyzed, or the alternative selected for implementation).",

NRCS completed an analysis of 51 recent site-specific dam rehabilitation EAs, all resulting in a finding of no significant impact. NRCS concluded that 34 of these projects could have been categorically excluded because the proposed action was limited to the dam construction footprint, which was previously disturbed during construction. The remaining 17 project-specific EAs did not meet the CE criteria because the rehabilitation construction footprint exceeded the original dam construction footprint or involved other actions outside the scope of the CE. These CEs are limited to developed areas, so this modification is not expected to create any new development.

(Now 7 CFR 1b.4(d)(33).) An allotment management plan (AMP) is a document that specifies how the components of the program action will be implemented to reach a given set of objectives. An AMP is prepared in consultation with the permittee(s) associated with the allotment, and it prescribes the manner and extent to which livestock operations will be conducted; describes the type, location, and construction specifications for rangeland improvements; and contains such other provisions relating to livestock grazing on the associated allotment (see 36 CFR 222.1(b)). AMPs are created after a unit's land management plan and a site-specific grazing decision, both of which undergo their own NEPA analysis. An AMP is the outcome of the grazing decision process. The presence or absence of an AMP does not change the on-the-ground effects of a rangeland improvement because AMPs do not override land management plans or grazing decisions. As such, the revision of language in the categorical exclusion is a minor change and technical in nature and does not modify the way rangeland improvements are designed or implemented, nor what is authorized in the land management plan or the grazing decision. Currently, most Forest Service grazing allotments have AMPs in place, making this CE unavailable to them. The proposed minor wording change will allow Federal agencies to efficiently maintain or improve rangeland conditions and animal distribution by eliminating a restriction based on paperwork requirements rather than indicators of whether the action may have significant effects, as was considered when initially establishing the category.",

The interim final rule will not compel the expenditure of $100 million or more, adjusted annually for inflation, in any one (1) year by State, local, and Tribal governments in the aggregate or by the private sector. Therefore, a statement under section 202 of the Act is not required. This action also does not impose any enforceable duty, contain any unfunded mandate, or otherwise have any effect subject to the requirements of 2 U.S.C. 1531-1538.",
