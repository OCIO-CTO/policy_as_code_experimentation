# Prompts and Steps Documentation

This file documents the key prompts, decisions, and steps taken throughout the Policy As Code Experimentation project. It serves as a running log for transparency and reproducibility.

---

## Initial Steps
- Created repository for experimenting with AI-driven policy-as-code using NEPA XML regulations.
- Decided to use Databricks for analysis and code generation.
- Established collaborative, learning-focused approach leveraging AI at each step.

## Housekeeping
- Added README with project overview and guidance.
- Added .gitignore, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md for best practices.

## Databricks Setup
- Created notebook in workspace
- Figured out that I cannot get a file from URL, I would have to upload. _AI initially gave faulty information. I failed to capture the prompt._
- Figured out how to upload.  _AI initially gave faulty information. I failed to capture the prompt._

### Prompts
**How do I read and parse my uploaded XML file in Databricks**
> You can use the following code to read and parse your XML file using xmltodict: 
```
[code snipped]
```
**Result:** Successfully read and imported xml as a python dict.

**I want to create a README for what we're doing here.**  
  
**Result:** AI lacked context to create a README, so I had to provide a detailed summary, then prompted the AI to create it again, which it did, but it was not good.

**That doesn't read like a README. It reads like a bulleted list of what I've already told you.**  

**Result:** AI rewrote README to be more narrative and welcoming.  

**What about for my repo in general? Do I have missing files? Suggest some good housekeeping.**  
> Recommended adding .gitignore, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, and other best practice files.  
**Result:** Chose to add items 1-4. Files successfully created.

**Let's also create a "prompts.MD" file (or similar) documenting all the steps we've taken**  
> Created prompts.md to document key steps, prompts, and decisions.
