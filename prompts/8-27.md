# Prompts and Steps Documentation â€“ August 27, 2025

This file documents the key prompts, decisions, and steps taken on August 27, 2025, for the Policy As Code Experimentation project. It serves as a running log for transparency and reproducibility.

We started the day going round and round with Databricks, which simply refused to read the XML file or keep the contents in context. Finally we moved to VS Code and tried it there. Although Databricks didn't cooperate, it did help us refine our prompts below. We had intended to use Claude in VS Code, but accidentally found the default GPT-4.1 agent worked pretty well:

**I want to take 2025-12326.xml (in context), analyze it, and leverage you, the AI, to generate policy rules as code from it. This is regulatory policy, not any other kind of policy. Please walk me through all the steps to do so, and ask any clarifying questions you may have.**
> Provided a step-by-step workflow for analyzing the XML and generating policy-as-code, including clarifying questions about output format, scope, use cases, and metadata.
**Result:** User clarified preferences: JSON format, full scope, support for automation/compliance/documentation, and inclusion of metadata. AI summarized the workflow tailored to user preferences, recommended JSON, and outlined next steps for parsing, extracting, designing schema, translating, and validating.

**Give me a sample python notebook first Note that I already have a dict, using xmltodict.**
> Added a markdown cell to the notebook explaining the workflow for extracting requirements and generating policy-as-code in JSON format.
> Added a sample code cell to demonstrate extracting regulatory requirements and metadata from the parsed XML dict and building a sample JSON policy rule.

**I want you to take the xml file in context, read it, and refine the extraction logic based on what's found.**
> Added a code cell that refines the extraction logic to identify regulatory requirements, decision points, and metadata from the actual XML structure, using keyword scanning and citation extraction.
**Result:** User can now run the cell to extract targeted policy rules from the XML and further refine logic or translation as needed.
